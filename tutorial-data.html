<h2><a name="tutorial1" class="anchor" href="#tutorial1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Find and prepare data</h2>
<p>The first step on getting data displayed on your mobile app is actually to get the data, and make it compliant with the converter.</p>
<h3>How to find data ?</h3>
<p>This can be achieved in various ways : you may already have some data you'd like to put on a map (such as a spreadsheet or a list of places), or you can get existing files on data portals. All you need is <strong>data that contains a location or an address</strong>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Easiest way is to check an open data portal, and get CSV or Excel files from there. You can start by browsing these portals :
		<ul>
			<li>Citadel Data index : http://www.citadelonthemove.eu/en-us/opendata/opendataindex.aspx</li>
			<li>Belgium : http://data.gov.be/datasets</li>
			<li>France : http://www.data.gouv.fr/</li>
			<li>UK : http://data.gov.uk/data</li>
			<li><strong>Tip:</strong> Try to search for "Data" + your city or location to check if there are data in your area</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You can also get a file from your city, association, or made by yourself. In that case you need to ensure that it doesn't contain personal data and that your are allowed to publish it (but that's another topic).</li>
</ul>
<h3>How should the data look like ?</h3>
<p>Once you've got your data file, you need to check that it meet the (few) pre-requisites so you will be able to convert it. Note this is really the trickiest part of the process, as having the rest of the process is pretty straight-forward.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>data format should be whether CSV or XLS or XLSX (Excel)</strong>. If you have a spreadsheet or table data in an other format (or web), you may have to "Export" or "Save as" Excel or CSV format. Most softwares and also databases will allow you to do that, including online editors such as Google Spreadsheet or Zoho.</li>
	<li>Ensure that you have some basic fields which will be helpful when you will want to display your data : a title and description for each element is fine to start (you could also include addresses, time information, or any other data). An nice field to add would be a "Category" field", as it will allow you to filter various data in the resulting app, and let user choose to display only markers for one specific category.</li>
	<li>Ensure that you have <strong>geographical coordinates</strong> in your file, that is "latitude" " and "longitude" or "LatLong" or "Geo-something", which contains numbers like "48.12345", or "48.12345,2.32105". That may sound like a tricky part, but if you have only addresses there are many tools around the web that will let you easily and freely convert adresses to geographical coordinates : that process is called <em>geocoding</em>. Here we will assume that your data does have this information, as there are many tutorials around the web to help you add it to your data have it if it doesn't have it already.</li>
	<li>Ensure that you have an "ID" for each line : an ID is basically a number which can be no more that a line number. All is required is having a different ID for each line, because only data with a unique ID will be displayed. So if there is no ID yet, just add a new column, name it "ID" or "unique number" (at your convenience), and put a line number in each field. If you're using Excel or LibreOffice, put "1" in first field, then write "=1+" in next field below, and select the "1" field. Then copy-paste that field to the whole column so that it automatically fills all IDs.</li>
	<li>Troubleshooting tip : if you experience problems with accents (é, ù, ß, etc.), your file may be encoded in something else than UTF-8. What you need is to save it using UTF-8 encoding (also known as Unicode) which is the world standard, and that will make it compatible anywhere. The process may differ depending of used software, but it's usually available as an option while saving the file.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tutorial2" class="anchor" href="#tutorial2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Convert your data</h2>
<p>Use the <a href="http://www.citadelonthemove.eu/en-us/opendata/convertmydataset.aspx" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-icon-external-link"></i> Citadel table to JSON Converter tool</a> to convert your CSV or XLS files into Citadel JSON that will be directly usable into your apps (see Converter tutorials, FAQ and How-tos)</p>
<p>Note : there are some hidden feature or useful tips to make the most out of the converter, here are a few common tips, but please refer to the Community forum and FAQ for detailed documentation and discussion.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The conversion process is a 2-step process : </li>
	<li>Geographical coordinates : if you have 2 separate "latitude" and "longitude" fields, you will need to "merge" them at step 2. To to that, drop the latitude field into the Geo coordinates, the drop a texte field and add an space in it, and finally drop the longitude field.</li>
	<li></li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="tutorial3" class="anchor" href="#tutorial3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Use the AGT to make an app</h2>
<p>If you've got that far, this is the easiest part : just select your dataset, select the 2 colors for your app interface, find a nice icon to represent your app, name and describe the app and... you're done ! It's that simple.</p>
<p>You'll certainly want to repeat the process a few times to try different datasets, combine datasets, or get back to the first 2 steps to adjust your raw or converted data to your needs.</p>
<br />
<br />



<h2><a name="tutorial4" class="anchor" href="#tutorial4"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Fork and customize a template</h2>
<p>Once you've played with the Application Generation Tool, you might want to get a bit further and probably host the application on your own server. This is were the templates matter : they basically provide the same kind of applications as the AGT, but you will be able to download them, and put them where you want. Furthermore, templates are fully reusable, so you can tweak them to include your town or organization logo, change the styles, interface, etc.</p>
